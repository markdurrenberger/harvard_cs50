Title pages - 
	how did he do the hello/name example?
		I can use the same technique to make it load the proper page (if it's there)

	I have the check for if entry exists working....but need to change all to .lower() so capitilization doesn;t
		throw it off...[X]

	[X] display the markdown content for entries that exist

Index page:
[X] how to use the page path/view inside of the url for each entry?

Search:
All of the below will be made within the layout.html file
[X] accept search queries in search box

	I started setting up a Django form for this....but got myself all in a jumble. Need to write out notes to myself
	about what I was doing and what is happening in the lecture example.
		....try walking through that task example myself

	[X] return the page for an entry, if it exists
		use the "page" view, passing title
	[X] if it doesn't match an entry, return a list of all entries where the term is a substring
		hmmm....
	[X] clicking on the results from above takes the user to that page
		should be able to use the concept from index page

New Page:
[X] set up a page and link to create new page
	[X] create a form that takes in a title and has a text box for markdown info
	[X] how to add the functionality of receiving the form info?
		[X] replace my inputs with Django forms...
			[X] create a class for NewPageForm
	[X] how to save the form data to a .md that gets stored in the application?
		Duh! using the util.new_entry() function

	[X] If page already exists, send to an error page

Edit Page:
[X] page with link set up
	[X] How to "get" the entry information for the page that sent to the edit page?
		Right now it just goes to an "edit" page, so not sure how to pre-fill with existing entry info
	[X] get the current md content to be the placeholder text in the form
		I've got the title coming over...can't figure out the placeholder text
			I think I need to look into classes in Python....need to somehow be able to pass the content information
			into my Form object creation
		Read more about Django forms too, that could help
	[X] make the form edit existing contents - 
	[X] how to get it to save and then render?
		Maybe using HTTPRedirect?
PICK UP HERE>>>  Need to read more about the reverse and HTTPredirect functions from the examples
	Let's try this again via a "confirmation" html page

GOT IT! Finally - just used the form data. Didn't need to worry about arguments and stuff in the form header.

Now just need to clean things up a bit (see below) and submit.


Random:
[x] send user to a random page by clicking the random link


Markdown:
[X] how to display markdown content as formatted HTML?

Cleanup stuff:
[X] use redirects to fix the URLs of search and random when user gets sent to new page
	[X] random
	[X] search
	[X] new > all need to have the redirected URL show
[X] make searchbar fit the <div> area (specify the widget attr "size": #characters)
	[X] & remove label (set the label parameter to an empty string)
------------------
[ ] is there a more efficient way to use the {{searchbar}} variable in the layout.html file? (right now
	I am passing it as context in every single view that renders a page)

	...there is something called a context processor that would work here....but will leave this for now.
------------------
[X] search results: the results are listed in all lowercase, how can I fix that? (use the actual terms, then
	use .lower() within the checking part, NOT at the beginning bc then it flowed through)
