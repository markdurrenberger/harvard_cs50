		throw it off...[X]

	[X] display the markdown content for entries that exist

Index page:
[X] how to use the page path/view inside of the url for each entry?

Search:
All of the below will be made within the layout.html file
[X] accept search queries in search box

	I started setting up a Django form for this....but got myself all in a jumble. Need to write out notes to myself
	about what I was doing and what is happening in the lecture example.
		....try walking through that task example myself

	[X] return the page for an entry, if it exists
		use the "page" view, passing title
	[X] if it doesn't match an entry, return a list of all entries where the term is a substring
		hmmm....
	[X] clicking on the results from above takes the user to that page
		should be able to use the concept from index page

New Page:
[X] set up a page and link to create new page
	[X] create a form that takes in a title and has a text box for markdown info
	[X] how to add the functionality of receiving the form info?

Edit Page:
[X] page with link set up
	[X] How to "get" the entry information for the page that sent to the edit page?
		Right now it just goes to an "edit" page, so not sure how to pre-fill with existing entry info
	[X] get the current md content to be the placeholder text in the form
		I've got the title coming over...can't figure out the placeholder text
			I think I need to look into classes in Python....need to somehow be able to pass the content information
			into my Form object creation
		Read more about Django forms too, that could help
	[X] make the form edit existing contents - 
	[ ] how to get it to save and then render?

Markdown:
[ ] how to display markdown content as formatted HTML?

Cleanup stuff:
[ ] use redirects to fix the URLs of search and random when user gets sent to new page
	[ ] random
	[ ] search
	[ ] new > all need to have the redirected URL show
[ ] make searchbar fit the <div> area & remove label
[ ] is there a more efficient way to use the {{searchbar}} variable in the layout.html file? (right now
	I am passing it as context in every single view that renders a page)
[ ] search results: the results are listed in all lowercase, how can I fix that?
