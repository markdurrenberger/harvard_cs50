Core fixes:
[X] error message if bid is less than current price
[X] fix the category listings page....not working right now
Add'l (cosmetic) items
[X] fix the display formatting of prices (always two decimals)
[ ] put in images? how to do that?
[ ] CSS styling on django forms


6/10 - Comments....build into auction page
	[X] Display comments on an auctions page
	[X] create form & view to allow user to add a new comment and put on page (like Bid)
	[X] add to page & troubleshoot
    - Add to Watchlist:
	[X] logic of whether or not something is on user's watchlist
	[X] form/functionality to add to watchlist - how to add to a manytomanyfield
		This is the command: In [8]: auction.watchlist.add(user)

6/7: tried this while Tina was watching TV....not good...need to be able to focus 100%. Wrap this one up this week...

5/24: for the close listing: if user is logged in AND user == auction.user (is the one that created it)
	close listing is done, including check to make winner (or no winner if no bids)

5/23 - long time off....hunker down this week:
	Got the categories piece working.
	...just create a list of all the categories from the objects.value_list() call
	...created the watchlist page too
	Now just need to add the final functionality to the listings page....
		- Comments[DONE]
		- Close listing[DONE]
		- Winner notification[DONE]
		- Add to watchlist (need to make sure they're logged in and this is NOT already on watchlist...if it is say "you're watching this"[DONE]
		- Error handling part of the bid view (only allow bids if they're higher than current price)[DONE]
	

5/3 - set up new bidding function
	...need to add in the error handling of it (make sure its a valid high bid)
	...then move into creating the watchlist functionlity - an html page and a way to add from listing page

5/2 - got the pricing logic working...needed to add it within the view
	now ran into an issue trying to set up a modelform and use that to create a new listing....pick up here with reading docs on modelforms

5/1 - got the models up and running and created some through the admin panel to make sure they're working. All seems good!

[X] Models - have at least 3 in addition to users
	[X] Auction listings 
	[X] Bids
	[X] Comments (made on auctions)

[X] Create Listings - users can visit a page to create a new listing. specify:
	[X] create html page and link within login wrapper
	[X] title, text-based description, starting bid
	[X] (optionally...they can also specify:) URL for an image, category
		need to assign the user who is logged in as the "user" and status as "active"
		(look at the example auctions in my admin login....make sure everything is accounted for)

		( ) Add CSS styling to the Modelform to make it look cleaner

[X] Active Listings page - default route should take users to a page listing all the active auctions
	[X] for each active listing display (at minimum):
		...title, description, current price, and photo (if exists)
		[X] Need to add the logic for current price
		
		( ) Can make the formatting look cooler too
		( ) Add image too
		( ) Should I add anything else like the listing user?

[ ] Listing pages - clicking on any active listing takes a user to that auctions individual page
	[X]  page should show all details about the auction (including current price)

	[X] Watchlist - if a user is signed in, they should be able to add the auction to their personal "watchlist"
	[X] Bids - if user is signed in, they should be able to bid on the item
		> Need to figure out how to deal with the error handling part of this...
			....maybe an extra if in the view which would return an error and display a message on teh page?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>[X] Error - if users bid is less than minimum bid or current bid, gets an error
	[X] Close Listing - if user is signed in AND created the listing, they should have the option to "close" the listing which 
		[X] makes the listing no longer active and 
		[X] makes the current highest bidder the winner
	[X] Winner notification - if user is signed in and on a closed listing page that they won, a message should specify that
		(X) on a closed auction page, people can't make further bids, and it says that the auction is closed
	[X] Comments - signed in users should be able to add comments to listing pages. 
		[X] all comments should be displayed on a listing's page

[X] Watchlist page - signed in users should be able to visit a Watchlist page that shows all items on their Watchlist
	if nothing on watchlist...say "nothing on your watchlist"

[X] Categories - users should be able to visit a page that shows a list of all the listing categories
	[X] Links - clicking the name of any category should take user to a page listing all of the active auctions in that category

[X] Django admin - a site admin should be able to view, edit, add, and delete all listings, comments and bids through the Django admin interface

Final fixes:
[X] bc of the str:name for category view...i can't get into the admin panel....?
	>however I fixed the above to get into admin panel...now the show lsitings by categories not working
[X] Closed listings (the close encounters one) shouldn't appear in the active listings page...right?


Cosmetic stuff:
[X] Fix the bid format on "A surprise"...why so many more than 2 decimal places?
[ ] CSS styling on the new listing form
----
Thoughts on pages:

New Listing page
	a page for users to create a new auction item
		specify: title, descripiton & starting bid (required)
		(optional): URL for an image &/or a category
		the user's name should also be captured and used to initialize that auction


Individual Listing pages
	clicking on the name of a listing on the main page takes you to its individual page
		shows all information about the listing, including current price (highest bid) and all comments on that auction
	If signed in...
		a button to add that item to their watchlist (or remove from watchlist if already on there)
		a form to submit a new bid on the item
			if bid is less than starting bid or current bid return an error message
			...otherwise, take in the new bid and update the current price of the item on the page
		a form to add a comment to that page
	If signed in AND creator of the auction...
		use has an option to "close" that listing
		...if that happens, the current high bid is the "winner"
	If signed in AND auction is closed AND user is the winner....
		page should display that the user has won that auction (a message at top of listing shoudl suffice)

Watchlist page
	only a signed in user can visit this page
	lists all of the auctions on their watchlist (each links to that listing's page)

Categories page
	any user should be able to visit a page that displays a list of all the categories
	each category name links to a page showing all active auctions in that category

















5/1 - these pages done for now too
Default page - Active Listings
	default route (index) should display all of the currently active listings
		display: title, description, current price (highest bid) & photo (if it exists)
		each listing should link to a page for that specific listing



	


5/1 - I think models are done
Thoughts on models:

Auctions - 
	X	title
	X	description
	X	starting bid
	X	(optional) URL of an image
	X	(optional) category of listing (one only)
	X 	Watchlist(?) - a list of users that have this auction saved on their watchlist
	X	current price - this would be tied to the related bids somehow
	X	user - that made the listing
	X	status - active (default) / closed
	X	winner - the user than won the auction (for closed auctions only)

Bids - 
	X	user - that made the bid
	X	auction - that the bid is tied to
	X	amount

Comments - 
	X	user - that made the comment
	X	auction - 
	X	description - text field
