- classes: I have these all set up now, only thing I need to work in somehow is User.watchlist
	I added this as a manytomany field in auctions....can call User.watchlist to pull up a user's watchlisted items
- bids: need to tie opening bid into Bid() model, NOT an attribute within auction

I think I can assign the information within the new() view and handle it that way:

To start:
- i'll use admin panel to create several users and categories
- I'll create two test items and some bids for them too

--
If I need to recreate db, do in this order:

users:
- FinnyFinnFinn
- Beebes
- Monster_Man

categories: 
- Toys
- Personal Care
- Furniture
- Home Goods
- Hobbies



auctions:
-
