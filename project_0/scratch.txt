Feeling lucky part:
added the button, but can't figure out how to add fuctionality. Two parts:
- one, simply how to make the button do something different (the html)
	Figured this out - formaction attribute. Nice!
- two, how to navigate directly to the page that comes up first from Google search results...
....Now to figure this out
